# GaussianMixtureModel

It is a ROS based implementation of Gaussian Mixture Model(GMM) algorithm for object detection.

ROS WORKFLOW  :-

(input_image)--(input)--->>  (object_detect)--(state)--->> (print)

USAGE  :-

window 1:     

    rosrun </directory name/> pub -vid </location of video/> 
   takes location of video as input and sends it to the node- object_detect via topic- input.
  
    
window 2:      
               
     rosrun </directory name/> gmm
   subscribes to the topic- input, performs algorithms on the image and publishes it on the topic- state
  
  .
window 3:      
        
    rosrun </directory name/> sub
   node print subcribes to the topic- state and prints the location of buoys in the video.
